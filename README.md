# nbd_dataMANA
Central data management hub of NBD data of neuropsychological battery for children validation project (boss: Kateřina Bukačová) I work with at the Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.

The goal is to take-in all kinds of disparate data sets and spit out pre-processed data matrices ready for analyses.

After extracting and wrangling the data, they are distributed for analysis to following repositories:

  - [irTEST](https://github.com/josefmana/nbd_irTEST.git) for IRT analyses where relevant
  - [reTEST](https://github.com/josefmana/nbd_reTEST.git) for test-retest reliability estimation
  - [nonMEM](https://github.com/josefmana/nbd_nonMEM.git) for a study of criterial validity of the nonverbal memory test from NBD (by Andrea Sadecká)
  - [normCALC](https://github.com/josefmana/nbd_normCALC.git) for a calculation of norms
